# Apax Template Package

This is a template package.

## Get Started

- Make sure the package name, excluding the scope, starts with `template-`, for example `@my-scope/template-app`.
- After publishing, use the template with `apax create @my-scope/app`. Note how the `template-` prefix is omitted.
- The template contents are located in the `template` directory. An `apax.yml` is provided by default for convenience.
- Don't forget to update this README with a description of the template before publishing!
